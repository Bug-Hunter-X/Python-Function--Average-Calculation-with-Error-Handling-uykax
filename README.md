This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The initial version includes a potential bug related to error handling. A corrected version is provided in the bugSolution.py file to address this. The bug is that the function does not correctly handle non-numeric inputs, which leads to a runtime error. The solution involves adding input validation to handle such situations.
